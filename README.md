# Arduino-Bluetooth-RC-Car
Turn an existing RC car into a Bluetooth controlled device with an Arduino and PS3 controller.

The project is to implement an Arduino microprocessor to control the functions of a pre-built RC car. The primary objective of this project was to make the car function using a PS3 controller. To implement the functionality and use the PS3 controller, we would use an open-source PS3 controller library. With the use of this library, we are able to use the PS3 controller to connect between the PS3 Bluetooth adapter and a USB Host Shield attached to the Arduino microprocessor. Once the connection is complete, we will be able to use the buttons on the PS3 controller to perform functions such as moving the car forwards, backwards, left and right.
